# Lab Report 3 - Researching Commands

**By Pranav Prabu**

> For this lab, I will be researching the functions of the `less` command.

## Option 1: -N

`$ less -N <file-path>`

Shows line numbers at the side of the opened file.

## Option 2: -X

`$ less -X <file-path>`

Keep the file open in the terminal even after finishing the command.

## Option 3: -p

`$ less -p<pattern> <file-path>`

Highlights all matches within the file with the given pattern (is case-sensitive).

## Option 4: -m

`$ less -m <file-path>`

Shows the percentage of the file read so far within the terminal.
